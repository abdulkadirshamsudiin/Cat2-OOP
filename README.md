# Java Programs Explanation
The programming concepts in this document are abstraction, method overloading, exception handling, and encapsulation.


## The cat Answers 
# Question 1A
### File Name: Student.java
**Concepts:** This demonstrates Encapsulation, Getters, and Setters  
- First we define a `Student` Class with 2 private attributes `name` and `grade`.
- We use **getters and setters** to control the access to the private attributes.
- next we Ensure the grade value always remains within a valid range ie (0-100).


# Question 1B
###  File Name: Main.java
**Concepts:** This question covers Polymorphism(Method overriding) and Method Overloading.
- This consists of `MathOperations` class shoing **method overleading** with multiple `multiply()` methods.
- it also includes an `Animal` class with a `makeSound()` method,which are overridden in the `Dog` and `Cat` subclass.
- This shows **runtime polymorphism** as it calls overridden methods dynamiclly.
 
# Question 2A
###  File Name: TestAppliance.java
- **Concepts:** This is to show Abstraction (Abstract Classes)
- First implement an abstract class `appliance` with an abstract method `trunOn()`.
- then the Subclass `Fan` and `TV` provide specific implementations of `runOn`.
- Then we Demonstrate **abstraction* by enforcing method implementation in the child classes.


# Question 2B
###  File Name: DivisionExample.java
- **Concepts:** This covers Expectation handling and user input
- The program will take 2 integers from the user and will divide them
- then it will handle the `arthmeticExpectation` to prevent division by zero.
- we use the `Scanner` object to take the user input.
